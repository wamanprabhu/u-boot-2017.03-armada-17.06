	  Enable driver model for SPI NAND flash. The SPI NAND flash interfaces
	  (spi_nand_flash_probe(), spi_nand_flash_write(), etc.) is then
	  implemented by the SPI NAND flash uclass. There is one standard
	  SPI NAND flash driver which knows how to probe most chips
	  supported by U-Boot. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi_flash.h, but is currently fully compatible
	  with the old interface to avoid confusion and duplication
	  during the transition parent. SPI and SPI NAND flash must be
	  enabled together (it is not possible to use driver model
	  for one and not the other).

	  Micron M79A SPI NAND support implement 03h/0Bh command, as is done
	  with SPI NOR for compatibility.
