ARMADA 37XX GPIO DT bindings
-----------------------
Required properties:
- compatible:           Should be "marvell,armada-3700-gpio"
- #gpio-cells: 		Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the second
  				cell specifies GPIO flags, as defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>.
                                Only the GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flags are supported.
- reg:                  The register base for the GPIO bank controller
- bank-name:            The GPIO bank name
- ngpios:               GPIO count in bank


Optional properties:
None

Examples:
Armada3700 example:
Armada3700 has two GPIO banks, one is the Northbridge GPIO bank and the other is the Southbridge GPIO bank.

	gpio0: gpio@13800 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-gpio";
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		reg = <0x13800 0x30>;
		bank-name = "armada-3700-north-bridge";
		ngpios = <36>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	gpio1: gpio@18800 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-gpio";
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		reg = <0x18800 0x30>;
		bank-name = "armada-3700-south-bridge";
		ngpios = <30>;
		status = "okay";
	};

When other nodes want to use a GPIO pin, the unit driver should support this.
For example, mmc0 can use the gpio1's 22nd pin for SDIO VCC setting as below.

mmc0: mmc@D0000 {
	sdio-vcc-gpio = <&gpio1 22 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	status = "okay";
};

When unit (USB/PEX/MMC) needs to use GPIO, the unit driver should support this.
For example: USB use GPIO pin #12 in the CP0 for VBUS enable as below:
	usb3@500000 {
		gpio-vbus = <&gpio1 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		status = "okay";
	};
